# 🌬️ Flappy Wind

Flappy Wind is an interactive twist on the classic "Flappy Bird" game, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. In this game, you not only control the bird's vertical movement with a click but also influence its flight path by creating powerful wind gusts with a mouse or touch drag.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Flap and Fly** : Click or tap to make the bird flap and gain altitude.
- **Dynamic Wind Gusts**: Drag and release the mouse or a touch input to create gusts of wind that propel the bird, consuming your wind energy.
- **Energy Management** : Your wind energy recharges slowly over time, requiring strategic use of your gusts.
- **Physics-Based Gameplay** : The bird's movement is governed by gravity and the forces from your wind gusts, adding a new layer of challenge.
- **Real-time Scoring** : Keep track of your score 🎯 and compete against your personal best 🏆.
- **Fluid Animations** : Smooth bird rotation, particle effects for flapping and wind, and a screen shake effect for collisions.
- **Responsive Design** : The game is built to be playable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **React** : A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** : A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Vite** : A fast and modern build tool for front-end development.
- **HTML Canvas** : Used for rendering all game graphics and animations.
